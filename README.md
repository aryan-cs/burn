# Burn

*Build, Tweak, Deploy.*

Burn enables people to create custom machine learning models using an intuitive sandbox UI. With visualizations to showcase concepts such as forward pass, gradient descent, backpropogation, and more in realtime, Burn helps users build an intuitive understanding of what's really happening under the hood. We currently support various models and algorithms such as Neural Networks (including AlexNet and an MNIST Database Classifier), Random Forest, Vision Language Models, and more.
